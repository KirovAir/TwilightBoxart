0.7
- Removed old Twilight++ aspect ratio's. Pure 1:1 ratio's are used now since the latest TWL++ (2020 and onwards) supports these! THIS BREAKS COMPATIBILITY WITH OLDER VERSIONS! Use 0.6 if your TWL++ is on a lower version.
- Added update checker.
- Added option to cancel searching and to overwrite existing boxart.
- Added border support. (This is some experimental trickery which makes boxart a bit more aesthetic on some themes, maybe in the future I'm able to do some tricks with 3d boxart and such)
- Moved parts of code to server. These will be open sourced later.

0.6
- Uses 1:1 boxart size for gba roms which should work with TwilightMenu++ v11.2.0 ('TWL Christmas release') and up! Please remove all old GBA boxart from previous versions so they will be redownloaded!
- Fixes some other small bugs as well.

0.5.3
- Finally fixed a really annoying issue where some images would appear to be corrupted in TWLM++. (Adobe Metadata issue, these are now stripped when images are downloaded)

0.5.2
- Fixed title matching for titles with '&' or '/' in the name.
- Detect correct aspect ratio for some japanese snes titles.

0.5.1
- Fixes SSL compatibility issues on older Windows versions. (Framework issue..)
- Improved some other code.

0.5 - Filename searching
- Added matching by file name.
- I've noticed that the NoIntro dat is not always a holy-match even when sha1 matches. (Tetris for the gameboy for example) As a final measure matching will be done on filename in this release, which should up the matching rate.

0.4 - LibRetro dat added
- Added LibRetro .dat format parsing for future data.
- Currently only added extra NES data as a test.

0.3
- Fixes Github SSL error for some users.
- Better error handling (and message) when there is no DB match.

0.2
- This version fetches the correct boxart for TwilightMenu++ 9.5.0 and onwards. Make sure you have 'Adjust to correct aspect ratio' checked.

0.1
- First release.
